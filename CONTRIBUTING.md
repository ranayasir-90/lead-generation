## 📝 Code Standards

### JavaScript/Node.js

- **ES6+**: Use modern JavaScript features
- **Async/Await**: Prefer async/await over callbacks
- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully
- **Comments**: Add clear comments for complex logic
- **Naming**: Use descriptive variable and function names

async function scrapeBusinessData(query, maxResults) {
  try {
    const results = await performScraping(query, maxResults);
    return processResults(results);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Scraping failed:", error.message);
    throw new Error("Failed to scrape business data");
  }
